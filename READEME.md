# Python_Workshop.Jan13
This repo contains the basics I learnt in the intro class of python and the assignments related to them.


Assignments:-

Q1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)*π*r^3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?

Q2. Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs. 240, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs
Rs. 25 for the first 20 copies and Rs. 15 for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for
60 copies?

Q3. We have v=u+at where v is velocity, u is initial velocity, and t is the time. And value for each is as
follows: v=25m/s. u=0m/s, t=10 seconds. Find the acceleration a. [Rearrange the equation, also use
proper formatting syntax while displaying the answer.]

Q4. Get the first name and last name from a user and use different string formatting techniques that we
learnt in class to get a formatted string.
For example: If user’s first name is Ram and last name is Bahadur, the output should be:
Hello! Ram Bahadur.

Q5. Take an arbitrary input string from user and print it 10 times.

Q6. Write a python script to demonstrate at least 10 built in functions in Python.

Q7. Write a function called disect that takes a list, modifies it by removing the first and
last elements
For example:
>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> disect(t)
>>> t
[2, 3]
